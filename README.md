*   Posture Checking: FitCV uses computer vision to track your body's movements and identify many exercises. The app can then provide real-time feedback on your form based on the positions of key body nodes which helps you avoid injuries and get the most out of your workouts.
*   Rep counting: FitCV can also count your reps by tracking the angles between key body nodes. This ensures that only correct reps are counted and the workout is done correctly.
*   Gesture navigation : FitCV is navigated using gestures the user uses their index finger to navigate the different menus within the app this allows them to use the application seamlessly.
*   Facial Recognition: FitCV can be used by multiple users and each user can have their own profile. One uses face detection to login into the application which is easier if someone is seated at a distance from the device.
